# Quiz_game-MUAMBA-CDOF3
## Description 
This project is based on developp a little Quizz Game.

## General ideas
What i **want** to do here, maybe, a primal frontend question askin for kind of quizz the user want based on certain choises.
Like a "case(), break" thing and after he can choose how many question he want and maybe the difficulty.

In the backend, i can try with a json file, containing some questions taken on Kaggle or something, filtered by type of question and level of difficulty.
And with that a table to save score.

I also want to search more about use a AI for generate questions.
With this solution, wo don't use to think about if questions are generated randomly.
But there's such problem about secret key for ChatGPT.

I will also explore how to run Llama in local to handle this problem.

I can also try Render, a platforme for backend in python or something.
